# ABout

The Banking Dashboard project focuses on building a user-friendly front end for an already established banking API. Using the provided Figma design and API documentation, our goal is to create a responsive and intuitive dashboard where users can manage their financial accounts seamlessly.
This project involves developing a front end with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. By following a structured approach, we start by analyzing the Figma design to break down the UI into manageable components and review the API documentation to understand data flows and integration points.

# Demo

# Features

1.Real-time Financial Data Display: The app integrates with an existing API to display up-to-date financial information from multiple accounts.

2.Component-Based UI: The user interface is built using reusable components, such as Navbar, Account Summary, and Transaction List, providing a clean and organized layout that is easy to navigate.

3.Responsive Layout: The dashboard will have a responsive design, ensuring it works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

4.Account Overview: Users can view a summary of their account details, including balances and recent transactions, allowing them to monitor their financial status at a glance.

5.Transaction List: A detailed list of transactions is provided, showing the user all their recent transactions. This list can be filtered and sorted for easier navigation.

6.API Integration: The app uses a service layer or custom hooks to fetch data from the API. This includes fetching transaction data, account details, and any other necessary financial information.

7.Error Handling and Loading States: The app includes robust error handling and displays appropriate loading states to provide a smooth user experience, even in cases where data might be delayed or not available.

8.Authentication Support: The app integrates with the provided APIâ€™s authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to user data.

9.Testing Suite: The app includes unit and integration tests to ensure components work as expected and the user experience is intuitive and error-free.
